## ðŸ§± Project Overview

The project uses **unsupervised learning techniques (Autoencoder and baseline LSTM)** to learn the normal patterns of the input time series. Anomalies are detected based on the **reconstruction error** produced by the trained model.

The workflow includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Performed in `data_analytics_preprocessing.ipynb`, including normalization and sequence generation.
2. **Model Training** â€“ Conducted in `Autoencoder_for_Anomaly_detection.ipynb`.
3. **Evaluation & Visualization** â€“ After training, anomaly scores and loss curves are visualized.  
   - Output figures are stored in the `Anomaly_figures` and `train_val_mse_loss` folders.

> ðŸ“Œ **Note**: The `.ipynb` files contain the code necessary to reproduce the training and evaluation. To reproduce the results, simply run the notebooks in order (preprocessing â†’ training).
